>What can LLMs do for KGs? Or, in other words, what role can KG play in the era of LLMs?

üôå This repository collects papers intergrating **knowledge graphs (KGs)** and **large language models (LLMs)**.

üòé Welcome to recommend missing papers through **`Adding Issues`** or **`Pull Requests`**. 

<!-- Details of summary and classification of papers are shown in [wiki](https://github.com/zjukg/KG-LLM-Papers/wiki). -->
